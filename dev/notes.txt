	- set developer mode
		- PC settings
			- Updates and Security
			- For Developers
		- control panel
			- programs
			- programs and functionalities (the install/deinstall window)
			- activate or deactivate windows functionality
			- subsystem for Linux
			- you may have to reboot
	- connect to sub-system
		- search for bash and execute, install it
			- (or Hyper)
		- `wsl`
	- install rvm
		- Ruby Version Manager
			- allows you to install multiple versions of ruby on the same system
			- switch between ruby versions easily
			- create and manage gemsets, isolated environments for Ruby gems, avoids version conflicts
		- https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-ruby-on-rails-with-rvm-on-ubuntu-20-04
		- `sudo apt update`
		- `sudo apt install gnupg2`
		- `\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby`
		- `source /home/test/.rvm/scripts/rvm`
		- `rvm list`
		- `rvm use 3.0.0`
		- `rvm install 3.4.0` (2025-05-23)`
		- get help
			- `rvm --help`
		- didn't need to use these:
			- `rvm install ruby` (install latest version of Ruby)
			- `gem install bundler`
	- install Rails
		- valid versions of Rails
			- `gem search '^rails$' --all`
		- install latest version
			- `gem install rails -v 8.0.2` (2025-05-23)
		- see version
			- `rails -v`
- HOWTO: install Ruby on Rails on Ubuntu
	- go to website
		- https://rvm.io
	- install GPG keys (to verify correct files being downloaded) 
		- `sudo apt update`
		- `sudo apt install gnupg2`
		- `gpg2 --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3 7D2BAF1CF37B13E2069D6956105BD0E739499BDB`
	- install RVM
		- `\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable`
			- note that this would also install the latest version of Ruby:
				- `\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby`
			- note that this would also install the latest version of Ruby and Rails:
				- `\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --rails`
		- activate rvm in current terminal
			- `source /home/edward/.rvm/scripts/rvm` (copy this from the output from above command)
	- list out the versions available of Ruby (the MRI versions are what you want - Matzâ€™s Ruby Interpreter, official and most widely used Ruby interpreter)
		- `rvm list known`
			- it shows 3.0.0 as the latest
	- install actual latest version
		- `rvm get stable`
		- `rvm install ruby --latest` 
			- (you'll have to enter your Ubuntu password)
			- seems to be installing 3.0.0 even though I was able to install 3.4.0 on Windows Subsystem for Linux
			- got error
		- `rvm install 3.4.0`
			- installing
			- finished in 30 seconds
		- `ruby -v` shows 3.4.0
			- trying to get it to list out 3.4.0
				- reinstalled rvm with "--ruby": `\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby`
				- got error again
		- `rvm list rubies`
		- ok, the main thing is that we can install the latest version (here: 3.4.0) even if the highest listed as available is 3.0.0
		- so, I want to see if I can install 3.0.0 along with 3.4.0 then switch between them
			- `rvm install 3.0.0`
				- got the same error
			- `rvm install 3.3.0`
				- ok, that worked
			- now `rvm list rubies` shows both
			- I can switch between them with
				- `rvm use 3.3.0`
				- `rvm use 3.4.0`
	- install Bundler
		- `gem install bundler`
	- update RubyGems
		- it asked to update so:
			- `gem update --system 3.6.9`
	- install Rails
		- `gem install rails`
		- `rails -v` shows 8.0.2
	- show all gems installed
		- `gem list` 
- HOWTO: install Ruby on Rails on Mac

	- `rvm install ruby`
	- `gem install bundler`
	- `gem install rails`
	- `brew doctor` 
- HOWTO: use Interactive Ruby
	- `irb`
- HOWTO: create a Rails project

			- I got: Run `bundle install --gemfile C:/edward/projects/apps/RUBY/Project001/Gemfile` to install missing gems.
			- `bundle install --gemfile C:/edward/projects/apps/RUBY/Project001/Gemfile`
			- same error
			- installing: https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/
