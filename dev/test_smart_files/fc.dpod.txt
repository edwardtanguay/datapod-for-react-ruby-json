Austen
[[
Jane Austen (1775–1817) was an English novelist known for her six major novels, which critique and comment on the British landed gentry at the end of the 18th century. Her works are notable for their wit, social observation, and strong female protagonists.

This is the only instance of “doleful” in her major novels, and it's used by the narrator (from Emma's point of view) to describe Emma’s earlier disappointment—highlighting Austen’s precise and slightly ironic tone.
